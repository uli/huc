The HuC software development kit is based on material from several sources,
with the most important ones predating a general awareness of software
licensing issues: both the C compiler and assembler are derived from
code from the early 1980s.

The authors that built on these foundations and extended them greatly in the
late 1990s and early 2000s have also generally neglected to specify the
conditions under which their versions can be used and redistributed.  It is
therefore next to impossible to make an exact statement on the legal status
of this collection of software.

I wish I could give more helpful information here, but I can only speak for
myself, and therefore the following license text ("Simplified BSD License")
applies to the changes and additions made by Ulrich Hecht only:
