    --------------------
    
      Four sets of memory mapped registers: $1A00-1A0A, $1A10-1A1A, $1A20-1A2A, $1A30-1A3A
    
    
        byte 0/1:     Data read/write registers.                
                                            
        byte 2/3/4:   Base address of the 2megabyte range. Format is 24bit: low, middle, high byte.
    
        byte 5/6:     Offset register. Format is 16bit LSB/MSB.
    
        byte 7/8:     Increment register. Format is 16bit LSB/MSB.
    
        byte 9:       Control register.
    
                      7654 3210    All eight bits of the Control register.
                      |||| |||+--- auto-increment enabled for INC reg (byte 7/8) (0: Disable / 1: enabled)  
                      |||| ||+---- Offset register (byte5/6), (to be) added to the base address. (0: Disable / 1: enabled)
                      |||| |+----- Treat byte7/8 as signed value (inc reg)  (0: Not signed / 1:Signed )
                      |||| +------ Treat byte5/6 as signed vlue (offset reg) (0: Not signed / 1:Signed )
                      |||+-------- Increment select. Apply INC register to base or offset (0: offset / 1: Base ) **
                      |++--------- Offset Trigger
                      |             00: none **
                      |             01: add offset on low byte write (5)
                      |             10: add offset on high byte write (6)
                      |             11: both **
                      +----------- Data port size (0: byte / 1: word) ** 
         
        byte $A:      Manual Offset Trigger. Any write to this register triggers adding the offset to the base address.
        
        
    Desciption:
    
      Data port
      ---------

             The DATA port register acts as an address register. It uses the value of the Base register for the address
            calculation, to point into AC memory. All access to the AC memory goes through these register sets. Depending
            on which bits are set in the control reg, different address calculation configurations can be used. You can
            have the Offset register index the Base register. You can also configure to have either the Base or the Offset
            register auto incremented or decremented on access to these Data registers.
            
 
      Offset
      ------
      
             The Offset register is basically a 'window' or 'index' register. It can be configured to be added to the Base
            register at the time of address calculation for memory fetch/store operations. It does *not* accumulate back
            into the Base register on every Data register access. When D1 of Control register is set, it functions as above.
            
             There are some other behaviors that can be applied with Offset register. With Byte $A, you can have the Offset
            register value added to the Base register. This is different than above and happens on each instance of writing
            to register Byte $A. This is a manual triggered add function. The value written to Byte $A is irrelevant. The 
            Base address accumulates the Offset register's value.
            
             If D6/D5 of the Control register are set to anything other than %00, the above add function is applied to Data
            port access. In some instances, this is redundant as it acts the same as the Increment register. But it can be
            configured so that the addition takes place on only one byte of the Data register set. This can be useful for
            incrementing on WORD size read/writes.
            
             Control register bit D3 defines how the 16bit value of the Offset register is used. If this bit is set, the
            Offset register value is treated as a signed number. This applies both to indexing function and add functions.
                        
 
 
      Signed extension
      ----------------
      
             Control register bits D2 and D3 effect how Offset and Increment register values are treated. When set to signed,
            the value is 2's complement.
            
             Signed status shouldn't have any effect when the Increment reg is added to Offset register. Both are 16bit and
            added normally as signed with or without the signed status. Where the bit does come into play, is when either
            the Increment or Offset register (or both) are added to the Base register. Since Base is a 24bit value, and the
            Offset and Increment register values are 16bit, these are signed extended to 24bit before being applied to the
            Base register.
          
    
      Auto-increment
      --------------
      
             When the Control register bit D0 is set, auto-increment function takes place upon every read/write of the Data
            register set. 
            
             The Increment register holds the value, to be added to another register. Control bit D4 sets which register is
            going to be 'incremented': the Base or Offset register.
            
             Control register bit D2 sets whether the Increment register value is sign extened to 24bit or not, when adding
            to the Base register.
    
    
      Offset increment
      ----------------
        
             When Control register bit D4 is set to 'Offset', the Increment register is added to Offset register. The Base
            register isn't effect. Fatal Fury Special uses this AC register block as a 16bit down counter.
            
              ; Byte7/8 = $ffff (-1)
              ; Byte9 = %101 (offset auto-increment on, Byte7/8 treated as signed, )
              lda $1a10     ; <- Triggers the auto-increment
              lda $1a15
              ora $1a16     ; <- if both LSB and MSB of Offset is $0000, then loop finished.
              bne loop
              rts 
              
            First read ($1a10) increments Offset by -1. ORing LSB/MSB of Offset, if the result sets the Z flag (both are 00)
            then finish, else jump back (continue loop). 
            


    AC General Registers
    --------------------

      These registers have specific memory locations and not groups like the previous mentioned set of registers.

          
        $1AE0: Byte 0-3     A 32bit register. Format: lowest,low, mid, high byte.
        
        $1AE4: Byte 0       Amount to shift the 32bit register. Lower 4 bits/nybble value is signed.
        
        $1AE5: Byte 0       Amount to rotate the 32bit register. Lower 4 bits/nybble value is signed.
        
        $1AEC: Byte 0-1     Should return $00/00.         

        $1AFE: Byte 0       When read, gives the version number of the Arcade Card.
        
        $1AFF: Byte 0       Arcade Card ID = $51. Use to detect the card.


    Desciption:
      
      Shift register
      --------------
            
             The last byte ($1AE3) is a latch. When this is written to, all four bytes are copied into an internal
            32bit register. Reading back from this last byte, also activates the latch mechanism. I.e. you can write
            to one of the lower 3 bytes, and then read from the last byte to update the register. The value in the 
            32bit register is always treated as unsigned when the shift logic is applied.
            
      Shift/Rotate
      ------------
        
             The register is 8bits, but only the lower 4bits are used for the shift/rotate operation. The upper 4bits
            are still held in the register, and can be read back. The lower four bits are signed, so it controls the 
            direction of the shift/rotate. Only writing to these two registers activates the shift mechanism/logic. 


    AC Bank Data Registers
    ----------------------

      Four banks of Data registers mirrored through out 8k. Each bank corresponds to one of four Address register sets.

          
        Bank $40          Data registers 0/1 of $1A00 mirrored in the 8k bank.

        Bank $41          Data registers 0/1 of $1A10 mirrored in the 8k bank.

        Bank $42          Data registers 0/1 of $1A20 mirrored in the 8k bank.

        Bank $43          Data registers 0/1 of $1A30 mirrored in the 8k bank.


    Desciption:
      
      Mirrored Registers
      ------------------
            
             The mirrored registers served a specific purpose. They allow you to use the Txx block transfer instructions
            with the Data register ports. The are no port-to-port block xfer instructions. In order to get AC port reads
            to VDC port writes, you need a special Txx instruction that just doesn't exist. A clever work around is to
            organize a set of ports, so that you can read them out in sequential fashion - like that of normal sequential
            linear addressing.
            
             These ports, are mirrored one after another for a single 8k block. It works both for VDC->AC and AC->VDC,
            although the bigger benefit is actually for transfering to VRAM. Each bank of $40-43 corresponds to one of four
            sets of AC Data registers. This also means you are limited up to 8k in a Txx single instance. So you'd have to
            you remap the *same* bank number to the next page register(s), for larger than 8k transfers. If you want to xfer
            data to vram, you use the normal TIA instruction. And reading from VRAM to AC, you use the TAI instruction.
