
 -*[ PCE Support Library v2.51 ]*-
    ---------------------------


        The assembler support library consists of various macros, functions,
        subroutines, and definitions designed to make it easier to write 
        programs for the PC-Engine.

        In the current release of the library, the source code has also been
        commented to aid in understanding.  Feel free to browse the code.


    What's included
    ---------------

        EQU.INC: Definitions
        --------------------

            A set of symbolic names have been defined for well-known
            hardware addresses (ie. videoport = $0000).  These are
            intended to fully replace literal values.


        FUNC.INC:  Functions
        --------------------

            A set of functions are included, to calculate derived
            values at compile time.  These are intended to be easy to use,
            and to replace difficult-to-understand literal values.

            For example, to display the character stored at VRAM $1000
            using palette #4, one would store the value '$4100' in the
            BAT table.  A function would automatically do the required
            bit-shifting at compile time.

            A full list of these functions is included.


        MACRO.INC:  Macros
        ------------------

            A set of macros for commonly-used sequences of code 
            (such as 16-bit operations on this 8-bit CPU).

            A full list of these macros is included.


        LIBRARY.INC, SPRITES.INC, VDC.INC:  Macros
        ------------------------------------------

            Macros used as simple interfaces to common subroutines
            with multiple parameters.

            A full list of these macros is included.


        LIBRARY.ASM:  Subroutines
        -------------------------

            A set of useful subroutines is included, mostly for
            manipulation of the hardware.

            A full list of these subroutines is included.


        MATH.ASM:  Subroutines
        ----------------------

            A set of mathematics subroutines. Contains 8, 16 and 32-bit
            (unsigned) multiplication subroutines and a 24-bit pseudo random
            number generator.


        SCROLL.ASM:  Subroutines
        ------------------------


        SOUND.ASM:  Music player
        ------------------------


        STARTUP.ASM:  Startup code
        --------------------------

            The initial startup of the program can appear daunting to
            a first-time PCE programmer.

            The included startup code initializes all necessary hardware,
            and jumps to the user's "main" label in his program.  It also
            contains interrupt-handlers and code to poll the joysticks
            (which is performed at each VSYNC interval).


    Functions
    ---------

        Three functions are defined in 'FUNC.INC':


        BATVAL
        ------

            Create a value for the BAT map, based on a palette index
            and a VRAM address.

                BATVAL  .func    (\1 << 12) | (\2 >> 4)

            The function takes two arguments, the first argument is the
            palette index (0-15), and the second argument is the address
            in VRAM.

            Example:

                        setvwaddr  $0
                        stw  BATVAL(4,$1000),video_data


        CHAR
        ----

            Same function as BATVAL but create a BAT value for a
            character defined using '.defchr', or any data that
            has a palette and VRAM attribute attached to it (using
            .pal and .vram directives).

                CHAR    .func    (PAL(\1) << 12 | VRAM(\1) >> 4)

            The function takes one argument, the name of a label.

            Example:
                        setvwaddr  $0110
                        stw  CHAR(zero),video_data

                zero:   .defchr  $1000,$0,\
                                 $00111110,\
                                 $01000011,\
                                 $01000101,\
                                 $01001001,\
                                 $01010001,\
                                 $01100001,\
                                 $00111110,\
                                 $00000000


        SPR_VRAM
        --------

            Return shifted value of VRAM address, main usage is for setting
            the sprite-pattern address in a SATB entry.

                SPR_VRAM .func   (VRAM(\1) >> 5)

            The function takes one argument, the name of a label.

            Example:

                        spr_set  #0,ram_satb
                        spr_pattern #SPR_VRAM(zero)

                zero:   .defspr  $5000,$0,\
                                 $00111110,$00000000,\
                                 $01000011,$00000000,\
                                 $01000101,$00000000,\
                                 $01001001,$00000000,\
                                 $01010001,$00000000,\
                                 $01100001,$00000000,\
                                 $00111110,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000,\
                                 $00000000,$00000000


    Macros
    ------

        MACRO.INC
        ---------

            This file contains many useful macros, as well as a complete set
            of 16-bit macros.


            The 'map' macro
            ---------------

                Useful macro to map a ROM bank into addressable memory.
                With this macro you don't need to remember in what bank
                your data are stored, just use 'map label' to map the
                bank where 'label' has been defined.

                Example:

                                map my_data

                                .bank 4
                                .org  $8000
                    my_data:    .dw   $0123,$4567,$89AB,$CDEF

                This example will map bank 4, at address $8000.


            16-bit pseudo instructions
            --------------------------

                'macro.inc' contains a few macros to make 16-bit operations
                a piece of cake. :) 

                Here's a list of those macros (see directly in 'macro.inc'
                for the exact syntax):

                    stw     - store a value
                    addw    - addition
                    adcw    - addition with carry
                    subw    - substraction
                    sbcw    - substraction with carry
                    cmpw    - comparison

                The macros above accept two arguments, the first argument
                is the source and can be either an immediate value (ie. #4)
                or a memory location (ie. <$10, $2500), and the second
                argument is the destination, this last one can be only
                a memory location.

                The following macros accept only one argument, a memory
                location.

                    stwz    - store a zero value
                    incw    - increment
                    decw    - decrement
                    rolw    - left rotation through carry flag
                    rorw    - right rotation through carry flag
                    aslw    - arithmetic shift-left
                    lsrw    - logical shift-right
                    negw    - negate (2's complement)


            8-bit pseudo instructions
            -------------------------

                Three 8-bit pseudo instructions are defined in 'macro.inc':

                    neg     - negate the accumulator (2's complement)

                    add     - same as the 'adc' instruction, but this
                              macro takes care to reset the C flag
                              before doing the addition

                    sub     - same as 'sbc' but set the C flag
                              prior to doing the substraction


            Branch alias macros
            -------------------

                Rather than using 'bcc' and 'bcs' when checking the result
                of a comparison, you can use these two macros instead:

                    blo
                    bhs

                They mean respectively 'Branch if Lower' and 'Branch if
                Higher or Same'. They are more easy to remember than
                'bcc' and 'bcs'.


            Long branch macros
            ------------------

                The HuC6280 only supports 8-bit signed offsets in conditionnal
                branch instructions, in some cases that can be too short. The
                following macros can be used when a longer branch is needed.

                    lbne
                    lbeq
                    lbpl
                    lbmi
                    lbcc
                    lbcs
                    lblo
                    lbhs


            Special macros
            --------------

                Some macros have a second form, with an underscore that
                precedes them. Those macros are the same as the macros
                without an underscore, the difference is these macros
                preserve the state of the registers they use (at the
                expense of speed).

                Here's the list of these macros:

                    _stw
                    _addw
                    _adcw
                    _subw
                    _sbcw
                    _cmpw
                    _incw
                    _decw


        LIBRARY.INC
        -----------

            This file contains support macros to call library subroutines,
            see 'Subroutines' paragraph for a description of those macros.

            There are just three macros that are not directly associated
            with a subroutine:


            setcolor
            --------

                This macro sets individual colors.

                    - setcolor index, r, g, b

                The macro has four arguments, the first argument is the
                color index in the palette (0-511), and the three following
                arguments are respectively red, green and blue color
                components (0-7).

                Example:

                        setcolor #0,#7,#7,#7    ; set the main background
                                                ; color to white


            setmap
            ------


            scroll
            ------


        SPRITES.INC
        -----------

            See the 'sprites.txt' document for a complete description of all
            the sprites macros.


        VDC.INC
        -------

            This file contains useful macros to directly program the video
            controller of the PC Engine.


            vreg
            ----

                This macro selects a video register. It writes the register
                index in the adequate VDC I/O port, but it also puts a copy
                of the register index at ZP location $F7, to remember which
                VDC register is currently selected.

                Example:
                                vreg #2
                                stw  #$0123,video_data


            setvinc
            -------


    Subroutines
    -----------

        All the subroutines take their arguments from pseudo registers
        placed in ZP. There are six 16-bit registers, ax, bx, cx, dx,
        si and di. The first four registers can also be used as pair
        of 8-bit registers, ax is split into al and ah, bx into
        bl and bh, etc...

        Those registers are defined in the 'EQU.INC' include file.


        set_read
        --------

            Set the VDC VRAM read pointer and select VDC register 2
            (VRR) to directly read data.

            Takes one argument:

                di, the VRAM address

            Associated macro is: 

                - setvraddr addr


        set_write
        ---------

            Subroutine similar to 'set_read' but for the VRAM write
            pointer of the VDC.

            Takes one argument:

                di, the VRAM address

            Associated macro is: 

                - setvwaddr addr


        load_palette
        -----------

            Set the palette by block of 16 colors. You cannot change
            individual colors with this subroutine, use the 'set_color'
            macro to set individual colors.

            The PC-Engine has 32 blocks of 16 colors that can be used,
            the first 16 blocks are used for background CG, and
            the 16 others for sprites.

            The subroutine takes four arguments:

                al, the palette block index (0-31)
                bl, the bank index of the color data
                si, the memory address of the color data
                cl, the number of palette block to set

            Two macros are associated with this subroutine:

                - set_bgpal  index, data [, nb]
                - set_sprpal index, data [, nb]

            The first macro is used to set the background CG palette,
            and the second macro to set the sprite palette. Both
            macros use palette block indexes that range from 0 to 15,
            'set_sprpal' will internally add 16 to the index before
            calling 'set_palette'. 

            The third argument is optional, if omitted, 1 will be used
            by default.


        load_vram
        ---------

            Transfer a memory region to VRAM. This subroutine takes four
            arguments:

                di = destination address in VRAM
                bl = source bank index
                si = source memory address
                cx = number of 16-bit words to copy

            One macro is associated to this subroutine:

                - vload [vram,] data, size

            The first argument is the destination address, if it is omitted
            the macro will assume that you want to transfer a graphic
            object defined using .defchr or .defspr, and thus will use
            the default VRAM address of the graphic objet.

            The second argument is the source address and the third argument
            the number of 16-bit words to copy.

            Example:

                        vload $0100,text,#4
                        vload zero,#16

                text:   .dw $0123,$4567,$89AB,$CDEF
                zero:   .defchr  $1000,$0,\
                                 $00111110,\
                                 $01000011,\
                                 $01000101,\
                                 $01001001,\
                                 $01010001,\
                                 $01100001,\
                                 $00111110,\
                                 $00000000


        load_bat
        --------

            Transfer a background attribute table (BAT) from memory to VRAM.
            This subroutine takes five arguments:

                di = the destination base address in VRAM
                bl = source bank index
                si = source memory address
                cl = the number of character column to transfer
                ch = the number of row to transfer

            Associated macro is:

                - batcpy vram, data, w, h

            See the slideshow demo (SLIDSHOW.ASM) for an example of how
            to use this subroutine.


        load_font
        ---------

            Transfer a 8x8 monochrome font in VRAM. You can freely select
            the character foreground and background color.

            The subroutine takes six arguments:

                di = VRAM destination address
                bl = font bank index
                si = font memory address
                al = foreground (0-15)
                ah = background (0-15)
                cl = number of characters to copy

            Associated macro is:

                - fntcpy vram, font, color, nb

            Example:

                        fntcpy $1000,font,#1,#10

                font:   .db $00,$38,$4c,$c6,$c6,$c6,$64,$38     ;0
                        .db $00,$18,$78,$18,$18,$18,$18,$7e     ;1
                        .db $00,$7c,$c6,$0e,$3c,$78,$e0,$fe     ;2
                        .db $00,$fe,$0c,$18,$7c,$06,$c6,$7c     ;3
                        .db $00,$3c,$6c,$cc,$cc,$cc,$fe,$0c     ;4
                        .db $00,$fe,$c0,$fc,$06,$06,$c6,$7c     ;5
                        .db $00,$3c,$60,$c0,$fc,$c6,$c6,$7c     ;6
                        .db $00,$fe,$c6,$0c,$18,$30,$30,$30     ;7
                        .db $00,$7c,$c6,$c6,$7c,$c6,$c6,$7c     ;8
                        .db $00,$7c,$c6,$c6,$7e,$06,$0c,$78     ;9


        load_map
        --------

            ...

            Associated macro is: 

                - mapcpy vram, x, y, w, h

            Example:


        calc_vram_addr
        --------------


        set_bat_size
        ------------

            ...

            Associated macro is: 

                - setbgmap size

            Example:


        init_vdc
        --------

            Initialize the video controller:

                - set the screen resolution to 256x224
                - disable background layer and sprites
                - enable vertical and horizontal sync interrupts
                - set the BG map size to 64x32 (512x256)
                - set the SATB to $7F00
                - clear the video RAM

            This subroutine will be called automatically if you use
            the standard startup code (STARTUP.ASM).


        init_psg
        --------

            This subroutine initialize the sound generator. Stop all
            the channel and set all the volume to zero. If you use the
            default startup code (STARTUP.ASM), this subroutine will be
            called automaticaly at initialization time.
